  <p>Thanks for checking out the site!</p>
  <p>I started out as a mobile game developer during a time when there were no app stores, we used Java MIDP to make them, and they had to be less than 64kb :D 
  <p>I've started and joined a few other game companies since then. Currently I'm CTO of 
  <a href="https://outplay.games/" target="_blank">OPGames</a>, an open-source game platform company building tools for game developers to 
  navigate this new landscape called <a href="https://kernel.community/module-3/lock-it-open/" target="_blank">Web 3.0.</a></p>

  <p>I'm a <a href="https://kernel.community/" target="_blank">KERNEL</a>
  <a href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-kernel/" target="_blank">Genesis Block</a> Fellow, currently leading the 
  <a href="https://web3.gg/" target="_blank">Gaming Guild</a>. KERNEL has taught me that itâ€™s our responsibility 
  to understand the social and economic effects of the systems that we create. 
  Knowing this, I hope to help create games that will benefit the world.
