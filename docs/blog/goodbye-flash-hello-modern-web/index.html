Gardenscapes, Pokemon Go, Candy Crush-- all games that have been there for more than 5 years.</p> <p>It may not be <strong>Creative Chaos</strong>, but hey, it works very, VERY well.</p> <hr> <p>Looking back at Flash's timeline and seeing the slower trickle of games as it nears its end-of-life, it saddens me that we might have lost the spark of innovation that it has started.</p> <video controls loop width=100%> <source src="https://www.flashgamehistory.com/video/FlashGames.mp4
" type=video/mp4> </video> <p>But as I read through Jonas Richner's heartfelt tribute and the testimonials of all these developers that I look up to; I realize that while Flash may be gone, its spirit of innovation continues on-- in HTML5 game developers and open-source web developers, collectively called the Modern Web.</p> <p>A perfect example is the impressive <a href=https://shapez.io target=_blank rel=nofollow>Shapez.io</a> by <a href=https://tobspr.com/ target=_blank rel=nofollow>Tobias Springer</a>: A <a href=https://github.com/tobspr/shapez.io target=_blank rel=nofollow>fully-open source</a> factory building game made in Javascript. It even has a native version with an <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318690/shapezio/ target=_blank rel=nofollow>Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam</a>.</p> <img alt=Shapez.io src=https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1318690/extras/store_page_gif.gif> <p>We have <a href=https://toughlovearena.com/ target=_blank rel=nofollow>Tough Love Arena</a> by M. Paul Weeks and Amy Xu, a web-based fighting game that has better netcode and replay function than even some of the bigger fighting games out there. </p> <img alt="Tough Love Arena" src=toughlovearena.png> <p>And we have impressive game-like experiences that push web technology even further than Flash did, with WebVR + Mobile experiments like <a href=http://accessmars.withgoogle.com/ target=_blank rel=nofollow>Access Mars</a> by Google and NASA.</p> <img alt="Access Mars" src=accessmars.png> <p>These games show us that the Modern Web is ready to take on the mantle and carry on Flash's legacy-- </p> <p>at least technically. </p> <p>To fully do so, it has to inherit Flash's superpowers. </p> <h2 id=what-were-flashs-superpowers>What were Flash's Superpowers?</h2> <p>Luckily, Jonas Richner has listed down each of them for us! The 3 superpowers that the Modern Web has to inherit Mega Man-style are:</p> <h3 id=1-decentralization>1. <strong>Decentralization</strong></h3> <p>Through the years, the game industry has shifted away from the web and centralized more and more around app stores and social networks. In <a href=https://medium.com/thrive-global/its-time-to-redesign-the-attention-economy-f9215a2210be target=_blank rel=nofollow>today's attention economy</a>, these platforms became the arbiters of success.</p> <p>Consequently, game developers were incentivized to focus less on innovating and more on the platforms' two most important metrics: <strong>discoverability</strong> and <strong>in-app monetization</strong>.</p> <p>The Modern Web needs to shake up these incentives. </p> <p>There are some promising attempts: On discoverability we have new standards such as <a href=https://github.com/tcmg/open-mini-games target=_blank rel=nofollow>Tom Greenaway's Open Mini Games</a> format, while on monetization we have the <a href=https://webmonetization.org/ target=_blank rel=nofollow>Web Monetization</a> standard. We also have new options like <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Offline_Service_workers target=_blank rel=nofollow>PWAs and Service Workers</a> that can allow games to be deployed like a native app outside of the app stores.</p> <p>There is still much to do though, and those looking to fix the discoverability problem can learn a lot from <a href=https://gamediscoverability.substack.com/ target=_blank rel=nofollow>Simon Carless' GameDiscoverCo newsletter</a>.</p> <h3 id=2-the-flash-workflow>2. <strong>"The Flash Workflow"</strong></h3> <p>While making games today is easier than ever before, developers bemoan that we've lost "The Flash Workflow".</p> <p>Tom Fulp of <strong><em>Newgrounds</em></strong> said:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Flash was the first program that merged art and code in a way that I always hoped could be possible."</p> </blockquote> <p>From Brad Borne of <strong><em>The Fancy Pants Adventures</em></strong> : </p> <blockquote> <p>"For someone who made videos, stop motion animations, built contraptions, and generally felt the urge to just making something, Flash just felt like exactly what I needed."</p> </blockquote> <p>Oliver Joyce of <strong><em>Swords and Sandals</em></strong> continues with:</p> <blockquote> <p>"...even now, HTML5 gaming struggles to hold a candle to what Flash could do a decade ago"</p> </blockquote> <p>And this sentiment is echoed throughout the FlashGameHistory.com testimonials.</p> <p>I believe it's not so much the developer experience, which has gotten progressively better with no-code tools and mature engines like Unity and Unreal. </p> <p><strong>It's more that us developers aren't making games for ourselves anymore.</strong> </p> <p><strong>Instead, we're making them the way they need to be in order to succeed in the app stores.</strong></p> <p>I am reminded of Bret Victor's talk, <a href=https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/inventing-on-principle-by-bret-victor target=_blank rel=nofollow>Inventing on Principle</a>: </p> <iframe height=360 src=https://player.vimeo.com/video/36579366 width=640 allowfullscreen frameborder=0 title=vimeo-player></iframe> <p>The whole video is a must-watch, but one quote stood out to me as a poignant reminder on what the Modern Web needs to provide game developers:</p> <blockquote> <p>Creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating.</p> </blockquote> <p>The "Flash Workflow" allowed brilliant creators to be closer to the work. </p> <p>In our quest to integrate analytics, ads, and in-app SDKs, we've lost that connection.</p> <h3 id=3-rapid-iteration>3. Rapid Iteration</h3> <p>Lastly, the Modern Web needs to inherit Flash's capability of getting out of the way of developers, allowing them to realize their visions as easily and quickly as possible.</p> <p>This at least is something the Modern Web has consistently pushed the envelope in. The Modern Web moves very fast, largely due to the open-source ethos.</p> <p>I am reminded of a quote in Eric S. Raymond's seminal essay <a href=http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ target=_blank rel=nofollow>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>It may well turn out that one of the most important effects of open source's success will be to teach us that play is the most economically efficient mode of creative work.</p> </blockquote> <p>The past few years have given us game engines like Phaser and Babylon, multiplayer server technology like Nakama and Colyseus, component frameworks like React and Svelte. </p> <p>All these technologies are being used to create the future of web games, free and open-source, and will someday form the backbone of Flash's eventual successor.</p> <hr> <p>With Flash's light dimming as the new year starts, it at least give us clarity on what its successor needs to do to carry the torch.</p> <p>The Internet has changed from when Flash first appeared 20 years ago. </p> <p>It's a much noisier place. </p> <p>The incentives for making content such as games have changed. </p> <p>Players' behaviors have changed. </p> <p>Flash reminds us of a different time, when creators were closer to their creations, when their motives and incentives were less complicated. It was a time of great innovation, and, for a lot of the Flash developers, a time of more meaningful connections.</p> <p>As new technologies like decentralized storage, decentralized identity, zero-knowledge proofs, and cryptocurrencies appear, we are again empowered to rewrite our core loops.</p> <p>We need the Modern Web to coalesce now around what Flash used to stand for-- a platform for creative chaos. We have to look back at that time when games were made for fun, and break the incentive and game loops that we're all used to running.</p> </article> <hr> <div class=svelte-5qew12> <img alt="Paul Gadi" src=profile-pic.png class=svelte-5qew12> <p class=svelte-5qew12> 🙏 Thanks for reading!
